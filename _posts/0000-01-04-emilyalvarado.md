title: "Search Engine Algorithms!"

*Algorithms are rules programmed to act on data as humans might do. The oldest algorithms are embedded in search engines and control how content is rated and ranked for search results.

*Google search engines run several hundred algorithms in a single instance globally. The algorithms in different regions have elements unique to their region because language and lexicons are different across regions or at the local city level.

*Search engines regularly update their algorithms (often on a monthly or quarterly basis); these updates can be considered “software patches” to the algorithm.
